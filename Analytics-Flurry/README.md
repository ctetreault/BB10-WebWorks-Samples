## Required Plugins ##

####The following Cordova Plugins are required for this sample:####

	com.blackberry.app
	com.blackberry.system
	com.blackberry.ui.toast


## How to get started

Note: This sample is collecting live analytics data. To use this sample code in your own application, you must first [register](http://www.flurry.com/signup.html) with Flurry and create your own application. A unique application key will be generated, and used to track analytics for your own app.

**1. Register with Flurry**

To begin tracking your own applications usage, you must [Sign-up for Flurry](http://www.flurry.com/signup.html). Once registered you will be able to create a new application and obtain your unique app "key" (used for tracking analytics). If you'd like to run this sample app using my test keys that's fine as well, just remember that in order to track your own analytics you'll need to register for an account.

***2. Use your own key***

Your application key is used to identify your specific app on the Flurry server, so it knows which app is being tracked. If you are using this sample code for reference and did not replace my key for yours, you will not see any analytics data when you login to your Flurry dashboard.

To use your own key, edit the following code on ***line 31 of js/app.js***.

```
FlurryAgent.startSession('<your key here>');
```

***3. Tracking events and usage***</br>

Flurry has done an amazing job at creating simple, easy to follow instructions for how to get started. Rather than duplicate their efforts I ***strongly*** recommend that you read their ***HTML5 Analytics README*** document that's sent to you when you register with Flurry.

## How to Build

1. Clone this repo to your local machine.

2. Ensure the [BlackBerry 10 WebWorks SDK 2.0](https://developer.blackberry.com/html5/download/sdk) is correctly installed.

3. Open a command prompt (windows) or terminal (mac) and run the following command:

	```
	webworks create <your source folder>\Analytics-Flurry
	```

4. **Replace** the default Analytics-Flurry\www folder with the \www folder from **this** project

5. **Replace** the default Analytics-Flurry\config.xml with the config.xml from **this** project

6. From the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (mac), navigate to the Analytics-Flurry folder

	```
	cd <your source folder>\Analytics-Flurry
	```

7. Run the following commands to configure plugins used by **this app**

	```
	webworks plugin add com.blackberry.app
	webworks plugin add com.blackberry.system	
	webworks plugin add com.blackberry.ui.toast
	```

8. Run the following command to build and deploy the app to a device connected via USB

	```
	webworks run
	```
