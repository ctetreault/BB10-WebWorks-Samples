	com.blackberry.utils
	
## Using The Sample ##

####Development Mode
**To test locally you *must* enable development mode in your code *before* making any calls to the Payment Service!**

	// turn on development mode for the payment service
    blackberry.payment.developmentMode = true;


####Making a Purchase


**The following code is used make a purchase. You'll be prompted with a Purchase dialog where you're able to set the properties of your purchase. *(See screenshot 2)***

	var paymentObject = {
    	"digitalGoodID": "123",
        "digitalGoodSKU": "",
        "purchaseAppName": "Payment Sample",
        "purchaseAppIcon": null,
    };
    
    // call the payment service
    blackberry.payment.purchase(paymentObject,

        // success callback
        function(data) {
            var msg = "Successfully purchased a: " + data.digitalGoodSKU;
            blackberry.ui.toast.show(msg, false);
            coins[data.digitalGoodSKU]++;
        },

        // error callback
        function(data) {
            var msg = "Error: " + data.errorText;
            blackberry.ui.toast.show(msg, false);
		}		
	);
        
####Check Existing Purchases

**The following code is used for checking existing purchases. An object will be returned to you which lists all of the purchases the user has made in your app.**

*Note that for local testing you must pass in *'false'* to the API call. The returned purchase object will apply for the current application instance, and clears upon exit.*

    blackberry.payment.getExistingPurchases(

		// pass in 'false' for local mode
    	false,

	    // success callback
    	function(data) {
			console.log('success: ' + data);
	    }, 
	    
	    // fail callback
		function() {
	    	console.log('fail');
	    });    
    }
