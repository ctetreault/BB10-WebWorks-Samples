**Hammer.js Setup**
We simply specify the element which we will be monitoring for swipe events.  In this case it's the "content" div.
```
var contentSwipe = new Hammer(document.getElementById("content"), {});
```

**Capturing the gestures**
```
contentSwipe.onswipe = function(ev) {
	var dir = ev.direction;

	// swipe from right-to-left
	if (dir === 'left') {
		// do something

	// swipe from left-to-right
	}  else if (dir === 'right') {
		// do something
	}
};
```
